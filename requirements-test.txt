# Minimal dependencies required to run the test suite.
# The smoke tests only import llm_models_extraction.py at module level,
# which requires only openai and jsonschema at import time.
# Heavy OCR/ML packages (paddleocr, docling, python-doctr, etc.) are
# lazy-imported at runtime and must NOT be listed here — they cause
# multi-minute install times in CI and are not needed for unit tests.
